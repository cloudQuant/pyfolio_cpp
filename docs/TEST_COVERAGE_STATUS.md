## 🛠️ Current Test Suite Issues

### 1. **API Compatibility Issues**
Many existing test files use APIs that don't match current implementation:

- `TimeSeries.data()` → Should be `TimeSeries.values()`
- `Transaction.side` → Missing field definition
- `Transaction.datetime` → Should be different field name
- Missing `TransactionSide` enum
- Function namespace mismatches

### 2. **Missing Function Implementations**
Some functions are declared but not implemented:

- `pyfolio::visualization::PlotEngine::generate_svg_plot()`
- `pyfolio::io::save_returns_to_csv()`
- Various visualization plot functions
- Some rolling metrics functions

### 3. **Linker Issues**
- GTest library path issues on macOS
- Missing symbol definitions for template functions

## 🎯 **Estimated Current Coverage**

### **Functional Coverage: ~75-80%**
- ✅ Core data structures: 95%
- ✅ Basic performance metrics: 90%
- ✅ Drawdown analysis: 90%
- ⚠️ Advanced features: 60-70%
- ❌ Complete test validation: 30%

### **Code Coverage: ~60-70% (estimated)**
- Core modules are well-tested through functionality
- Advanced modules need test completion
- Integration testing incomplete

## 📋 **Current Test Status**

### **Tests Currently Running (✅ Working)**
1. `test_core` - Core data types and Result<T> monad (18 tests, all passing)
2. `test_statistics` - Mathematical statistics functions (17 tests, all passing) 
3. `test_plotly_enhanced` - Visualization with Plotly.js (13 tests, all passing)
4. `test_datetime` - Date/time handling and business calendars (10 tests, all passing)

### **Tests with Issues (⚠️ Needs Attention)**
1. `test_time_series` - 10 passing, 2 failing (alignment, missing values)
2. `test_performance_metrics` - 14 passing, 4 failing (drawdown, alpha/beta, rolling)
3. `test_transactions` - Built but not fully validated
4. `test_positions` - Built but not fully validated

### **Tests Not Built Yet (❌ Pending)**
- `test_risk_analysis` - Risk analytics module
- `test_attribution` - Performance attribution
- `test_capacity_analysis` - Capacity analysis
- `test_bayesian_analysis` - Bayesian methods
- `test_regime_detection` - Market regime detection
- `test_data_loader` - CSV/file I/O
- `test_tear_sheets` - Report generation
- `test_rolling_metrics` - Optimized rolling calculations

## 📋 **Strategy to Reach 95% Coverage**

### **Phase 1: Fix Critical Test Failures (Priority 1)**
1. Fix `test_time_series` alignment and missing value logic
2. Fix `test_performance_metrics` drawdown and rolling metric calculations
3. Validate `test_transactions` and `test_positions`
**Expected:** Reach 80% coverage

### **Phase 2: Build Missing Analytics Tests (Priority 1)**
1. Build and run all analytics module tests
2. Fix any compilation/API issues discovered
3. Ensure all core financial calculations are tested
**Expected:** Reach 90% coverage

### **Phase 3: Add Comprehensive Edge Cases (Priority 2)**
1. Add negative test cases and error conditions
2. Test boundary conditions and edge cases
3. Add integration test scenarios
**Expected:** Reach 95%+ coverage

### **Phase 4: Advanced Features (Priority 3)**
1. SIMD and parallel processing tests
2. Memory management and caching tests
3. REST API and visualization edge cases
**Expected:** Reach 98%+ coverage

## 🏆 **Production Readiness Assessment**
